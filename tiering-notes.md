# Tiering

- chunk vs chunk_info mixup

- alloc.sources / frag.accessible_blocks

- deletions

- get_part_info/get_chunk_info for read_object_mapping/read_node_mapping/read_host_mapping - decide if to reverse so that chunks refer to parts.

- obj.upload_size updates during upload - preserve or remove?
